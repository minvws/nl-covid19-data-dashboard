## Summary

Brief explanation of the feature, and describe how other developers can test and see your implementation.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this PR is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the PR. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Opus to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
front-end to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

## Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- maintenance cost, how complex is the solution and how prone to change is it?
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for bigger features. What parts of the design are still
TBD or not implemented? How will you deal with that in the future?
