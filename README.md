# NL COVID-19 Data Dashboard

## Setup
Since we're using Next.js now, which collects telemetry data add:

```
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

To disable.

Run  `yarn` to install all required packages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `out` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. All pages are output as static html files through `next export`.
