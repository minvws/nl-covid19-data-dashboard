# NL COVID-19 Data Dashboard

The dashboard provides information on the outbreak and prevalence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands. It combines measured and modelled data from various sources to give a broad perspective on the subject. This is still in development, which means no conclusions may be drawn from it. Further improvements in accessibility, functionality and data will be made in the future.

## Monorepositoy

We've switched to a monorepository that contains both the front-end and the CMS configuration. If you want to run the front-end locally, go into `packages/web/` and check out the README there.

### Starting the front-end
`yarn`
`cd corona-dashboard-app`
`yarn download`
`yarn dev`
