Also the number of admissions of Covid-19 patients to the hospital and ICU strongly increased. The percentage of people who tested positive in the GGD test centres increased from 2.5% in the last week of August to 7.4% in the past week. \n\nRisk level per region can be ‘caution’ (level 1), ‘concern’ (level 2) or ‘serious’ (level 3). The situation in 11 of the 25 safety regions is concerning. In Amsterdam-Amstelland, Haaglanden and Rotterdam-Rijnmond, the situation is considered serious.",

        "antwoord": "The dashboard presents up-to-date information about coronavirus in the Netherlands. It uses data provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals. The dashboard shows, for example, how many people have been tested for the virus, and how many tested positive."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why a dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "Over the past several months, many people have become ill because of coronavirus and many people have died. Until there is an effective vaccine, the virus can easily flare up and again make large numbers of people ill. The dashboard shows if and where the virus is gaining ground. Using this information we can take control measures faster and in a more targeted way, such as introducing additional measures only in the regions with sharply increasing infection rates. Measures must always be based on a comprehensive political assessment of all relevant aspects, including broader social and economic interests."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Whose dashboard is it?",
        "antwoord": "This dashboard has been commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. New types of data will be added to it in the weeks ahead."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why use these figures?",
        "antwoord": "The data on the dashboard gives a good overall view of the situation regarding coronavirus in the Netherlands. Some of the figures are about the virus and new outbreaks. Other figures help administrators to better calculate the risk of new waves of infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why is the dashboard still being developed?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard will remain under development as long as coronavirus is still with us, because we are always looking to see if we can add better data. Moreover, it takes time to set up the dashboard properly. So we’re expanding it step by step. We also want the information on this website to be easy to read on any device, and to be available in Dutch and in English. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What is an alert value?",
        "antwoord": "An alert value is a kind of ‘alarm bell’, determined by the Ministry of VWS. These alarm bells can go off if a large number of people test positive, fall ill or are admitted to hospital at the same time. It’s been calculated that the healthcare sector would soon be unable to cope if daily hospital admissions for COVID-19 exceed 40 per day for an extended period of time. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What can I use the figures about my municipality or region for?",
        "antwoord": "Coronavirus doesn’t spread uniformly. Sometimes it flares up in one region, while in others the infection rate remains low. If we have an accurate picture of this, we can combat the virus quickly and in a targeted manner. That’s why the data on the dashboard is also broken down by municipality/region. This also helps mayors decide if local measures are necessary."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Is this one of the apps that was announced?",
        "antwoord": "No, this is not an app. An anonymous contact tracing app is being developed so that people can find out if they might have been in close proximity to someone carrying coronavirus, and to advise them what to do. A home monitoring app will help the municipal health service (GGD) stay in touch with people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Does the dashboard respect my privacy?",
        "antwoord": "Yes, the dashboard complies with privacy rules, so the data can’t be traced back to individuals. All the data is provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals, and is accessible to everyone. The dashboard lists its data sources. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What conclusions can I draw based on the information on this dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard shows how the situation per region is developing with regard to coronavirus. The data is used by municipal, regional and central government authorities to decide on the measures necessary to stop the spread of the virus."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "I can see that coronavirus is under control in my region. So why do the same measures apply here as in other regions?",
        "antwoord": "The situation varies widely, and some regions have been worse affected than others. But the virus can easily spread across the country and that’s why many measures apply nationwide. Sometimes, extra measures are taken in a specific region if there are many extra cases there. These are largely based on input from experts, and consultations with the GGDs and safety regions. "

Any corrections to historical data, such as double counting, are processed by the RIVM on the day the error was discovered. This means the number of new cases reported for that day is lower than the actual number, but this is offset by the numbers being too high on previous days. Because of such corrections, it is possible for the current day’s cumulative number to be lower than the number for the day before. This is then depicted as 0 (zero) on the dashboard, as a negative number is confusing. This is why discrepancies arise when regional data is aggregated into national data. If you would use the negative values of the safety regions to calculate the daily number of confirmed cases, you would find the correct values. "

That is why the line depicting R stops at a date two weeks in the past.\n\nThere is a clear break in the R trend on 11 June. On that date, RIVM began calculating R using the number of daily positive tests and the number of hospital admissions. Before 11 June, the R was based only on the number of new hospital admissions.

We do this by dividing the Netherlands’ total population by 100,000. Then, we divide the absolute number of infectious people by the outcome of that division. The resulting figure is the number of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe RIVM bases the number of infectious people on the daily reports of the number of people with COVID-19. Until 30 June this value was based on the daily number of patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19. Because the number of people currently being admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 is low, the number of people reported as having COVID-19 is a better indicator to track the progression of the number of infectious people.\n\nRIVM calculates the number of infectious people based on the number of infected people and the duration of the infectious period. The duration of the infectious period differs from one person to another, but is between 6 and 10 days. The number of infected people is based on the number of COVID-19 cases reported. RIVM uses a conversion factor to take account of people who are infected with coronavirus but who remain unreported. The conversion factor is derived from confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions and the percentage of people whose blood contains antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. RIVM is considerate of the fact that a tiny percentage of the tests could give a false positive result.\n\nThere is no alert value for the number of infectious people as this number is an estimate based on a calculation."

Once a week at each site, researchers from the National Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) examine samples of sewage water collected over a period of 24 hours. These tests show how many virus particles are in the sewage water. Each week the number of sites may vary, because not every test can be completed successfully. Please note that the values from before 20 July are based on about 28 sites. The figures between 20 July and 31 August are based on about 80 sites. From 31 August sewage water from about 300 sites is examined. In the current research we can see trends in the amount of virus particles, like an increase or decrease. We cannot yet compare the number of particles found at different sites. More research is necessary in order to be able to draw conclusions based on the findings.\n\nOnce a week (on Tuesdays), this information is delivered [as an open data file by the RIVM](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_rioolwaterdata.csv). With the availability of more data, the number of virus particles can be determined more accurately. Therefore, the RIVM has adapted their method to calculate the virus particles per milliliter since 18 August. In the open data file you can see if a measurement in representative of not. For the dashboard we only use representative data.\n\nThe graph’s y-axis shows the concentration of virus particles in one milliliter of sewage water. The x-axis shows the date on which the samples were collected. The national and regional average are weekly averages. The sum of the reported values in the week is divided by the number of sites that completed the tests that week. The reported weeks are from Monday up and until Sunday. These weekly averages are shown in the graph on the Monday of the week.\n\nThe virus particles per milliliter shown on the dashboard can be influenced by a number of other factors. For instance, due to rainfall, the number of virus particles per milliliter can be decreased, because the sewage water is diluted. Furthermore, industrial areas in the catchment areas can bring about this effect, because in the sewage water of industrial areas little to no amount of human faeces can be found. If the concentration of virus particles is too low, it will no longer be found by the test. This will then result in a measurement of zero particles per milliliter.\n\nTo determine which location belongs to which safety regions, we look at the catchment area. This is the area for which the sewage treatment plant purifies the water. The RIVM shares per site the percentage that the catchment area is part of the safety region. This is not entirely accurate and will be improved on in the future. Some sites have a catchment area that contains multiple safety regions. If this is the case, the site is attributed completed to the safety region covering the largest part of the catchment area.\n\nTo match the sites to the municipalities, we currently use the postal code of the site. Using the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) allocation of municipalities, these postal codes are translated to a municipality. In a few cases, no match was found. For these exceptions the municipalities are established by hand, using coordinates of the sites and a map. Please note: the matching of these sites with municipalities can be partly inaccurate, because the catchment area of purification site is not necessarily similar to the borders of the municipalities. This matching between sites and municipalities is currently being improved on."

    "toelichting": "Each week the coronavirus situation is assessed to see whether it is developing in a positive or negative direction. This assessment is carried out jointly by central government, the municipal health services (GGDs), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the safety regions. The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport then determines which risk level applies to each region. Do we need to exercise ‘caution’ (level 1), is the situation one of ‘concern’ (level 2) or is the situation ‘serious’ (level 3)?\n\nCentral government or the safety region in question will take appropriate measures based on the risk level. Measures depend on the local situation and may therefore vary from region to region.\n\nA region’s risk level is determined by looking at the situation in that region, in the surrounding regions and in the rest of the country. This is done on the basis of the coronavirus dashboard, RIVM’s weekly report and assessments by the GGDs and the safety regions. Several aspects are taken into consideration when determining the risk level:\n\n- How quickly is the number of new infections rising?\n- Are additional measures needed for vulnerable groups?\n- How effective is contact tracing?\n- How well are the measures being complied with?\n- Is there still sufficient healthcare capacity?\n\n**When is a region’s risk level raised to ‘concern’ or ‘serious’?**\nVarious figures are assessed to determine whether a region’s risk level needs to be raised to ‘concern’ or ‘serious’. This includes the number and percentage of positive tests:\n\n- A region’s risk level will in principle be raised from ‘caution’ to ‘concern’ if there are more than 50 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. This means that the alert value of 7 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants is exceeded each day. Or if more than 5% of tests are positive.\n\n- A region’s risk level will in principle be raised from ‘concern’ to ‘serious’ if there are more than 150 positive test results per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. Or if more than 10% of tests are positive.\n\nEvery Monday RIVM calculates to which regions this applies. A more in-depth assessment of the situation in these regions is carried out in the following days. If the situation in a region is one of ‘concern’ or ‘serious’, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (Hugo de Jonge) may decide to assign a higher risk level to that region. The above criteria are intended as a guideline.\n\n**What do the three risk levels mean?**\n\n1. Caution. The situation is manageable. The number of new infections is low. Vulnerable groups must remain alert. Contact tracing is largely effective. Measures are being sufficiently complied with and are enforceable. There is sufficient healthcare capacity. Any additional measures are designed to make the existing approach more effective.\n\n2. Concern. The situation is moving in a negative direction. The number of new infections is increasing. A tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. If the situation continues, contact tracing will become ineffective. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. Pressure on healthcare capacity is increasing. The existing approach needs to be strengthened through additional measures to get the virus under control again and return to a manageable situation.\n\n3. Serious. Severe measures are needed to prevent further escalation and return to a manageable situation. The number of new infections is increasing rapidly. An intensive tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. Contact tracing is no longer effective, making it more difficult to keep track of how the virus is spreading. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. There is insufficient healthcare capacity. Measures to be taken are designed to prevent regional healthcare from becoming overburdened and to be able to track the spread of the virus again."
