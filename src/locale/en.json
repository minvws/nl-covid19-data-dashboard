    "bericht": "In the past week (14 to 20 October) the number of people who newly tested positive rose, as did the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and ICU. However, the speed at which new infections increased seems to have slowed somewhat. This might be a result of the government policy measures issued late September. However, the number of hospital admissions continues to rise at the same pace. \n\nRisk level per region can be ‘caution’ (level 1), ‘concern’ (level 2), ‘serious’ (level 3) or ‘severe’ (level 4). At this moment the risk level of 16 regions is ‘severe’, for 7 it is ‘serious’ and for 2 it is ‘concern’.",

Any corrections to historical data, such as double counting, are processed by the RIVM on the day the error was discovered. This means the number of new cases reported for that day is lower than the actual number, but this is offset by the numbers being too high on previous days. Because of such corrections, it is possible for the current day’s cumulative number to be lower than the number for the day before. This is then depicted as 0 (zero) on the dashboard, as a negative number is confusing. This is why discrepancies arise when regional data is aggregated into national data. If you would use the negative values of the safety regions to calculate the daily number of confirmed cases, you would find the correct values. "

The average number of daily hospital admissions is calculated using the figures for one day ago, two days ago and three days ago. Data for the present day is not included in this calculation, as the present day is not yet over and registration data is therefore incomplete. Although hospitals strive to register COVID-19 patients as fast as possible, there is usually some delay. As a result, the figures for the previous several days tend to be incomplete. That is why data on the dashboard is refreshed daily.\n\nPreviously, the figures on the dashboard concerning hospital admissions were provided by [open data](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_aantallen_gemeente_per_dag.csv) from RIVM, which comes from the Osiris database. However, this database suffers from significant underreporting. The NICE database is more complete and uses a broader definition of hospital admission. RIVM figures include only those patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19, whereas NICE figures also include patients who were admitted to the hospital for another reason but also have COVID-19.\n\nNICE figures cannot currently be broken down by safety region or municipality.

The file is published online every day at 10.00 a.m. and registers the number of confirmed cases (people who tested positive) reported to the RIVM in the past 24 hours. The date used is the date of notification. This is not the same as the day on which people were tested.\n\nThe RIVM can retroactively correct data that was previously published. These corrections are then applied to the open data file on their site and will automatically be shown on the dashboard.\n\nThe source file contains figures per safety region and municipality. To obtain the national figures, all reports are added. In the sourcefile, not all reports mention a municipality or a safety region because this information is not available. These cannot be shown on that lower level, but will be shown in the national figures.\n\nWe use the absolute number of confirmed cases to calculate a relative rate per 100,000 inhabitants. We do this by first dividing the number of confirmed cases by the number of inhabitants in the Netherlands. This produces the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants, as shown on the dashboard. The number of inhabitants is determined by this [CBS file](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84721NED/table?dl=3A154).\n\nThe division of new cases by age group is based on the national figures, because ages are not recorded in the file containing municipal data. The table on the RIVM website in the 'COVID-19 weekly epidemiological update of the Netherlands' may therefore not always match the table on the dashboard.\n\nThe alert value for the number of confirmed cases is now added to the dashboard. The value is 7 confirmed cases per 100.000 inhabitants. This means that if this value reached, the number of infections is possibly increasing too fast to keep the novel coronavirus under control. The same value is also used by Germany for example. An alert value functions as a “warning” to examine the situation with urgency. It is possible that this alert value is further refined at another point in time.\n\nThe percentage of confirmed cases only concern tests performed by the municipal health services (GGD), and of which a test result is known.

Reproduction numbers (R) using data from less than two weeks ago are not reliable because the R depends on the incubation period (the time between someone becoming infected and becoming ill) and the reporting delay (the time between someone becoming ill and being reported as a COVID-19 case). That is why the line depicting R stops at a date two weeks in the past.\n\nThere is a clear break in the R trend on 11 June. On that date, RIVM began calculating R using the number of daily positive tests and the number of hospital admissions. Before 11 June, the R was based only on the number of new hospital admissions. With a low number of new admissions, the number of daily positive tests is a better indicator of R.\n"

This data cannot always be clearly linked to a specific safety region. As a result, the total sum of numbers at the safety-region level may be less than the numbers at the national level. The number of deaths of nursing home residents is based on the date of death. However, when the date of death is unknown that death is not included in this statistic in the dashboard.\n\nThe method used to estimate the numbers of nursing homes and nursing home residents infected with coronavirus has been improved. Since 1 July 2020, for every person newly infected with coronavirus, the municipal health services (GGDs) have noted whether that person lives in a nursing home. Until the end of September 2020, no use was made of this data and a different method was used to calculate infection numbers, which led to a significant overestimate of the number of infected nursing homes. As of 29 September 2020, the estimates on the dashboard from 1 July 2020 onwards have been recalculated using the this data and therefore now give a much better picture of the actual number of infected nursing homes and nursing home residents.\n\nOld definition of a nursing home resident: A person was counted as a nursing home resident if, according to the central database OSIRIS: on the basis of their postcode, they can be linked to a registered nursing home or residential care home for the elderly, a setting (place where infection may have occurred) labelled as a ‘nursing home’ or something similar, or if there is any other term that links them in the database to a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly. In addition, the person:\n- must be over 70 years old\n- must not be a health worker, and\n- must not be employed.\n\nNew definition of a nursing home resident: As of 1 July 2020, every time a person tests positive for COVID-19, the GGD asks whether that person is a resident of a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly. This information is used in the new definition. A person is considered to be a nursing home resident if, according to the data in OSIRIS:\n- This person is a resident of a nursing home or a residential care home for the elderly.\n- If it is not known whether the person lives in a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly, the old definition is used.\n\nThe total number of nursing homes per safety region is provided by RIVM. Any nursing homes with the same postcode are counted as one nursing home. This is because the number of infected nursing homes is also determined by postcode. It is necessary to know the total number of nursing homes per safety region in order to calculate what percentage of nursing homes in the safety region is infected. The total number of nursing homes nationwide is the sum of the total number of nursing homes in all safety regions.\n"

The values in the file are copied directly onto the dashboard. We also convert these absolute numbers into a relative rate of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants. We do this by dividing the Netherlands’ total population by 100,000. Then, we divide the absolute number of infectious people by the outcome of that division. The resulting figure is the number of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe RIVM bases the number of infectious people on the daily reports of the number of people with COVID-19. Until 30 June this value was based on the daily number of patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19. Because the number of people currently being admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 is low, the number of people reported as having COVID-19 is a better indicator to track the progression of the number of infectious people.\nRIVM calculates the number of infectious people based on the number of infected people and the duration of the infectious period. The duration of the infectious period differs from one person to another, but is between 6 and 10 days. The number of infected people is based on the number of COVID-19 cases reported. RIVM uses a conversion factor to take account of people who are infected with coronavirus but who remain unreported. The conversion factor is derived from confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions and the percentage of people whose blood contains antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. RIVM is considerate of the fact that a tiny percentage of the tests could give a false positive result.\n\nThere is no alert value for the number of infectious people as this number is an estimate based on a calculation.\n\nThe calculation method of the number of infectious people has been changed since 13 October. Between 1 June till 13 October this number was calculated based on the results of the first [Pienter Corona research](https://www.rivm.nl/pienter-corona-studie), the number of hospital admissions and the number of confirmed cases. From 13 October onwards, this number is calculated based on the results of the second Pienter Corona research and the number of hospital admissions.

Once a week at each site, researchers from the National Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) examine samples of sewage water collected over a period of 24 hours. These tests show how many virus particles are in the sewage water. Each week the number of sites may vary, because not every test can be completed successfully. Please note that the values from before 20 July are based on about 28 sites. The figures between 20 July and 31 August are based on about 80 sites. From 31 August sewage water from about 300 sites is examined. In the current research we can see trends in the amount of virus particles, like an increase or decrease. We cannot yet compare the number of particles found at different sites. More research is necessary in order to be able to draw conclusions based on the findings.\n\nOnce a week (on Tuesdays), this information is delivered as an open data file by the [RIVM](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_rioolwaterdata.csv). With the availability of more data, the number of virus particles can be determined more accurately. Therefore, the RIVM has adapted their method to calculate the virus particles per milliliter since 18 August. In the open data file you can see if a measurement in representative of not. For the dashboard we only use representative data.\nThe graph’s y-axis shows the concentration of virus particles in one milliliter of sewage water. The x-axis shows the date on which the samples were collected. The national and regional average are weekly averages. The sum of the reported values in the week is divided by the number of sites that completed the tests that week. The reported weeks are from Monday up and until Sunday. These weekly averages are shown in the graph on the Monday of the week.\n\nThe virus particles per milliliter shown on the dashboard can be influenced by a number of other factors. For instance, due to rainfall, the number of virus particles per milliliter can be decreased, because the sewage water is diluted. Furthermore, industrial areas in the catchment areas can bring about this effect, because in the sewage water of industrial areas little to no amount of human faeces can be found. If the concentration of virus particles is too low, it will no longer be found by the test. This will then result in a measurement of zero particles per milliliter.\n\nTo determine which location belongs to which safety regions, we look at the catchment area. This is the area for which the sewage treatment plant purifies the water. The RIVM shares per site the percentage that the catchment area is part of the safety region. This is not entirely accurate and will be improved on in the future. Some sites have a catchment area that contains multiple safety regions. If this is the case, the site is attributed completed to the safety region covering the largest part of the catchment area.\n\nTo match the sites to the municipalities, we currently use the postal code of the site. Using the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) allocation of municipalities, these postal codes are translated to a municipality. In a few cases, no match was found. For these exceptions the municipalities are established by hand, using coordinates of the sites and a map. Please note: the matching of these sites with municipalities can be partly inaccurate, because the catchment area of purification site is not necessarily similar to the borders of the municipalities. This matching between sites and municipalities is currently being improved on.\n"

    "title": "Level of risk",
    "toelichting": "Each week the coronavirus situation is assessed to see whether it is developing in a positive or negative direction. This assessment is carried out jointly by central government, the municipal health services (GGDs), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the safety regions. The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport then determines which risk level applies to each region. Do we need to exercise ‘caution’ (level 1), is the situation one of ‘concern’ (level 2) or is the situation ‘serious’ (level 3) or even ‘severe’ (level 4)?\n\nCentral government and/or the safety region in question will take appropriate measures based on the risk level. Measures depend on the local situation and may therefore vary from region to region.\n\n**What determines a region’s risk level?**\n\nA region’s risk level is determined by looking at the situation in that region, in the surrounding regions and in the rest of the country. This is done on the basis of the coronavirus dashboard, RIVM’s weekly report, and assessments by the GGDs and the safety regions.\nSeveral aspects are taken into consideration when determining the risk level:\n- How quickly is the number of new infections rising?\n- Are additional measures needed for vulnerable groups?\n- How effective is contact tracing?\n- How well are the measures being complied with?\n- Is there still sufficient healthcare capacity?\n\n**When is a region’s risk level raised to ‘concern’, ‘serious’ or ‘severe’?**\n\n- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘caution’ to ‘concern’ if there are more than 50 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. This means that the alert value of 7 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants is exceeded each day. \n- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘concern’ to ‘serious’ if there are more than 150 positive test results per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. \n- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘serious’ to 'severe’ if there are more than 250 positive test results per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. If the situation is ‘severe’ in multiple regions, the severest measures then apply to the whole country.\n\nEvery Monday RIVM calculates which risk level applies to which region. A more in-depth assessment of the situation in these regions is carried out in the following days. If the situation in a region is one of ‘concern’ or ‘serious’, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (Hugo de Jonge) may decide to assign a higher risk level to that region. The above criteria are intended as a guideline. Even if a region has not yet reached the alert values given above, the risk level may nevertheless be scaled up in light of circumstances and assessments.\n\n**When can the risk level in a region be scaled down?**\n\nAny decision to scale down the risk level in a region requires careful consideration of not only the number of new infections, but also healthcare capacity. After all, even if the number of new infections falls, the healthcare sector may still be dealing with large numbers of patients recovering from COVID-19. Healthcare professionals must also be given an opportunity to rest. The focus must be on preventing the virus from spreading quickly once more and the healthcare system becoming overburdened.\n\n**What do the four risk levels mean?**\n\n1. Caution. The situation is manageable. The number of new infections is low. Vulnerable groups must remain alert. Contact tracing is largely effective. Measures are being sufficiently complied with and are enforceable. There is sufficient healthcare capacity. Any additional measures are designed to make the existing approach more effective.\n2. Concern. The situation is moving in a negative direction. The number of new infections is increasing. A tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. If the situation continues, contact tracing will become ineffective. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. Pressure on healthcare capacity is increasing. The existing approach needs to be strengthened through additional measures to get the virus under control again and return to a manageable situation.\n3. Serious. Severe measures are needed to prevent further escalation and return to a manageable situation. The number of new infections is increasing rapidly. An intensive tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. Contact tracing is no longer effective, making it more difficult to keep track of how the virus is spreading. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. There is insufficient healthcare capacity. Measures to be taken are designed to prevent regional healthcare from becoming overburdened and to be able to track the spread of the virus again.\n4. Severe. More severe national measures are needed to prevent further escalation and return to a manageable situation. A very large number of people are infectious and the number of new infections is high. Contact tracing is no longer effective, meaning there is limited insight into how the virus is spreading. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. Regional healthcare capacity is insufficient and some kinds of regular healthcare have already been scaled down. Measures to be taken are designed to prevent national and regional healthcare from becoming overburdened and to regain maximum control of the virus."
