It uses data provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs), hospitals and other sources.

The dashboard is intended for everyone who wants a useful overview of the most up-to-date data."

      {
        "vraag": "Why a dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "Over the past several months, many people have become ill because of coronavirus and many people have died. Until there is an effective vaccine, the virus can easily flare up and again make large numbers of people ill. The dashboard shows if and where the virus is gaining ground. Using this information we can take control measures faster and in a more targeted way, such as introducing additional measures only in the regions with sharply increasing infection rates. Measures must always be based on a comprehensive political assessment of all relevant aspects, including broader social and economic interests."

This data includes the number of confirmed cases and the number of confirmed cases wiht COVID-19 who are admitted to a hospital. Other data will be added to the dashboard shortly. Together they will give an accurate picture of the epidemic in the Netherlands."

      {
        "vraag": "The dashboard is still in development. What does this mean?",

      },
      {
        "vraag": "What is an alert value?",
        "antwoord": "An alert value is calculated by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and is intended to act as a warning. A warning can be triggered if many people become ill or are admitted to a hospital at the same time. According to RIVM’s models, the healthcare sector will be unable to cope if daily hospital admissions for COVID-19 exceed 40 per day for an extended period of time."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What can the regional overview tell that the national overview cannot?",
        "antwoord": "Coronavirus spreads easily among people. In recent months RIVM has identified several regional surges in coronavirus infections. This means the infection rate was higher in some parts of the country than in others. If we have an accurate picture of this, we can combat the virus quickly and in a targeted manner."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Is this one of the apps that was announced?",
        "antwoord": "No, this is not an app. An anonymous contact tracing app is being developed so that people can find out if they may have been in close proximity to someone carrying coronavirus, and to advise them on what to do in that case. A home monitoring app will help the municipal health service (GGD) stay in touch with people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."

        "vraag": "What conclusions can I draw based on the information on this dashboard?",

      },
      {
        "vraag": "I can see that coronavirus is under control in my region. So why do the same measures apply here as in other regions?",
        "antwoord": "The situation in different regions can vary a lot, and the epidemic is much bigger in some regions than in others. But the virus can easily spread across the country and that’s why many measures apply nationwide. Sometimes, extra measures are taken in a specific region if there are many extra cases there. In the future we aim that the dashboard will make it possible to introduce measures that target specific regions or sectors."

      {
        "vraag": "Why do I find a different value for the total number of confirmed cases (people who tested positive) as shown on the site, if I add all the reported confirmed cases per safety region? ",
        "antwoord": "We calculate the increase in the number of confirmed cases (people who tested positive) by deducting  the current day’s cumulative number of confirmed cases reported from the cumulative number reported the day before. Any corrections to historical data, such as double counting, are processed by the RIVM on the day the error was discovered. This means the number of new cases reported for that day is lower than the actual number, but this is offset by the numbers being too high on previous days. Because of such corrections, it is possible for the current day’s cumulative number to be lower than the number for the day before. This is then depicted as 0 (zero) on the dashboard, as a negative number is confusing. This is why discrepancies arise when regional data is aggregated into national data. If you would use the negative values of the safety regions to calculate the daily number of confirmed cases, you would find the correct values. "

Deze dataset is geexporteerd en opgeslagen als een JSON-bestand. Het gaat dan om de versie van de dataset zoals beschikbaar op 10 april 2020 (laatste publicatie bij tijde van schrijven van deze verantwoording).\n\nWe berekenen de toename van het aantal positief geteste mensen door het gerapporteerde cumulatief aantal meldingen van positief geteste mensen van vandaag, af te trekken van het cumulatief aantal van gisteren. Dit vormt het absolute aantal meldingen van positief geteste mensen op het dashboard.\n\nDaarnaast berekenen we op basis van die absolute aantallen het genormaliseerde aantal besmettelijke mensen. Dit doen we door het aantal inwoners van Nederland te delen door 100.000. Vervolgens gebruiken we het getal dat daaruit komt en delen we het absolute aantal zoals aangeven in het bronbestand hierdoor. De uitkomst hiervan vormt het getal per 100.000.\n\nDe datum die gebruikt wordt is de datum van melding. Dat is niet hetzelfde als de datum waarop mensen zijn getest. Voor meer informatie kunt u de RIVM website [raadplegen](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/grafieken). Correcties over oude data, zoals dubbeltellingen, worden door het RIVM verwerkt op de datum dat dit bekend is. Het gerapporteerde nieuwe aantal meldingen voor die dag ligt dan lager dan het feitelijk aantal die dag. Daar staat tegenover dat voorgaande dagen er dus teveel gevallen zijn gerapporteerd.\n\nDoor correctie kan het cumulatieve aantal van vandaag lager zijn dan het cumulatieve aantal van gisteren. In die gevallen wordt er op het dashboard de waarde 0 gepresenteerd in plaats van een negatief waarde; een negatieve waarde kan namelijk feitelijk niet: je kunt geen -0,4 besmettingen hebben in de afgelopen 3 dagen. Daarom krijg je uiteindelijk verschillen als je regio's optelt naar landelijk. Landelijke gegevens zijn namelijk het cumulatieve getal van alle gemeenten afgetrokken van het cumulatieve getal van gisteren, niet de som van de uitkomsten van dezelfde berekening voor veiligheidsregio's. Als je met negatieve waarden voor veiligheidsregio’s zou rekenen kom je wel op de juiste getallen uit.\n\nDe leeftijdsverdeling wordt bepaald op basis van de landelijke cijfers, omdat in het gemeentelijke bestand geen leeftijden worden geregistreerd. Er kan daarom inconsistentie ontstaan tussen de tabel zoals weergegeven op de website van het RIVM en zoals weergeven op het dashboard."

The values in the file are copied directly onto the dashboard. The reproduction number is not an exact value but a reliable estimate. Reproduction numbers (R) using data from less than two weeks ago are not reliable because the R depends on the incubation period (the time between someone becoming infected and becoming ill) and the reporting delay (the time between someone becoming ill and being reported as a COVID-19 case). That is why the line depicting R stops at a date two weeks in the past.\n\nThere is a clear break in the R trend on 11 June. On that date, RIVM began calculating R using the number of daily positive tests and the number of hospital admissions. Before 11 June, the R was based only on the number of new hospital admissions. With a low number of new admissions, the number of daily positive tests is a better indicator of R."

RIVM is working with the municipal health services (GGDs) and Statistics Netherlands (CBS) to develop a more accurate method. The information on the dashboard will be updated as soon as this method is available.\n\nSometimes there seems to be a discrepancy between the new number of nursing homes with infected inhabitants, and the increase in the total amount of infected nursing homes compared to the day before. This is due to the fact that by newly infected nursing location, only the number is shown from the previous day. However, new infected nursing homes are not only reported from the day before, but sometimes earlier as well. As a consequence \\\"the number of new locations since yesterday\\\" is not always the same as the increase in total number of infected nursing homes. We are currently working to show this more clearly on the dashboard as soon as possible."

The values in the file are copied directly onto the dashboard. We also convert these absolute numbers into a relative rate of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants. We do this by dividing the Netherlands’ total population by 100,000. Then, we divide the absolute number of infectious people by the outcome of that division. The resulting figure is the number of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe RIVM bases the number of infectious people on the daily reports of the number of people with COVID-19. Until 30 June this value was based on the daily number of patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19. Because the number of people currently being admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 is low, the number of people reported as having COVID-19 is a better indicator to track the progression of the number of infectious people.\n\nRIVM calculates the number of infectious people based on the number of infected people and the duration of the infectious period. The duration of the infectious period differs from one person to another, but is between 6 and 10 days. The number of infected people is based on the number of COVID-19 cases reported. RIVM uses a conversion factor to take account of people who are infected with coronavirus but who remain unreported. The conversion factor is derived from confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions and the percentage of people whose blood contains antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. RIVM is considerate of the fact that a tiny percentage of the tests could give a false positive result.\n\nThere is no alert value for the number of infectious people as this number is an estimate based on a calculation."

        "verantwoording": "It is possible to test samples of sewage water for pathogens like the novel coronavirus, because they enter the sewage system via the faeces.  Once a week at each site, researchers from the National Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) examine samples of sewage water collected over a period of 24 hours. These tests show how many virus particles are in the sewage water. Each week the number of sites may vary, because not every test can be completed successfully. Please note that the values from before 20 July are based on about 28 sites. In the current research we can see trends in the amount of virus particles, like an increase or decrease. We cannot yet compare the number of particles found at different sites. The number of sampling points will be expanded from 80 sites now to over 300 sites from September onwards. Only when testing on this larger scale is complete, it will be possible to draw conclusions based on the findings.\n\nOnce a week (on Tuesdays), this information is delivered [as an open data file by the RIVM](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_rioolwaterdata.csv). With the availability of more data, the number of virus particles can be determined more accurately. Therefore, the RIVM has adapted their method to calculate the virus particles per milliliter since 18 August. In the open data file you can see if a measurement in representative of not. For the dashboard we only use representative data.\n\nThe graph’s y-axis shows the concentration of virus particles in one milliliter of sewage water. The x-axis shows the date on which the samples were collected. The national and regional average are weekly averages. The sum of the reported values in the week is divided by the number of sites that completed the tests that week. The reported weeks are from Monday up and until Sunday. These weekly averages are shown in the graph on the Monday of the week. The measured value per location is shown on the date on which the measurement took place.\n\nThe virus particles per milliliter shown on the dashboard can be influenced by a number of other factors. For instance, due to rainfall, the number of virus particles per milliliter can be decreased, because the sewage water is diluted. Furthermore, industrial areas in the catchment areas can bring about this effect, because in the sewage water of industrial areas little to no amount of human faeces can be found. If the concentration of virus particles is too low, it will no longer be found by the test. This will then result in a measurement of zero particles per milliliter.\n\nTo determine which location belongs to which safety regions, we look at the catchment area. This is the area for which the sewage treatment plant purifies the water. The RIVM shares per site the percentage that the catchment area is part of the safety region. This is not entirely accurate and will be improved on in the future. Some sites have a catchment area that contains multiple safety regions. If this is the case, the site is attributed completed to the safety region covering the largest part of the catchment area.\n\nTo match the sites to the municipalities, we currently use the postal code of the site. Using the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) allocation of municipalities, these postal codes are translated to a municipality. In a few cases, no match was found. For these exceptions the municipalities are established by hand, using coordinates of the sites and a map. Please note: the matching of these sites with municipalities can be partly inaccurate, because the catchment area of purification site is not necessarily similar to the borders of the municipalities. Currently, this matching between sites and municipalities is currently being improved on."
