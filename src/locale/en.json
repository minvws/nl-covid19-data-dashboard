It uses data provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals. The dashboard shows, for example, how many people have been tested for the virus, and how many tested positive."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why a dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "Over the past several months, many people have become ill because of coronavirus and many people have died. Until there is an effective vaccine, the virus can easily flare up and again make large numbers of people ill. The dashboard shows if and where the virus is gaining ground. Using this information we can take control measures faster and in a more targeted way, such as introducing additional measures only in the regions with sharply increasing infection rates. Measures must always be based on a comprehensive political assessment of all relevant aspects, including broader social and economic interests."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Whose dashboard is it?",
        "antwoord": "This dashboard has been commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. New types of data will be added to it in the weeks ahead."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why use these figures?",
        "antwoord": "The data on the dashboard gives a good overall view of the situation regarding coronavirus in the Netherlands. Some of the figures are about the virus and new outbreaks. Other figures help administrators to better calculate the risk of new waves of infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why is the dashboard still being developed?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard will remain under development as long as coronavirus is still with us, because we are always looking to see if we can add better data. Moreover, it takes time to set up the dashboard properly. So we’re expanding it step by step. We also want the information on this website to be easy to read on any device, and to be available in Dutch and in English. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What is an alert value?",
        "antwoord": "An alert value is a kind of ‘alarm bell’, determined by the Ministry of VWS. These alarm bells can go off if a large number of people test positive, fall ill or are admitted to hospital at the same time. It’s been calculated that the healthcare sector would soon be unable to cope if daily hospital admissions for COVID-19 exceed 40 per day for an extended period of time. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What can I use the figures about my municipality or region for?",
        "antwoord": "Coronavirus doesn’t spread uniformly. Sometimes it flares up in one region, while in others the infection rate remains low. If we have an accurate picture of this, we can combat the virus quickly and in a targeted manner. That’s why the data on the dashboard is also broken down by municipality/region. This also helps mayors decide if local measures are necessary."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Is this one of the apps that was announced?",
        "antwoord": "No, this is not an app. An anonymous contact tracing app is being developed so that people can find out if they might have been in close proximity to someone carrying coronavirus, and to advise them what to do. A home monitoring app will help the municipal health service (GGD) stay in touch with people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Does the dashboard respect my privacy?",
        "antwoord": "Yes, the dashboard complies with privacy rules, so the data can’t be traced back to individuals. All the data is provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals, and is accessible to everyone. The dashboard lists its data sources. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What conclusions can I draw based on the information on this dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard shows how the situation per region is developing with regard to coronavirus. The data is used by municipal, regional and central government authorities to decide on the measures necessary to stop the spread of the virus."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "I can see that coronavirus is under control in my region. So why do the same measures apply here as in other regions?",
        "antwoord": "The situation varies widely, and some regions have been worse affected than others. But the virus can easily spread across the country and that’s why many measures apply nationwide. Sometimes, extra measures are taken in a specific region if there are many extra cases there. These are largely based on input from experts, and consultations with the GGDs and safety regions. "

Any corrections to historical data, such as double counting, are processed by the RIVM on the day the error was discovered. This means the number of new cases reported for that day is lower than the actual number, but this is offset by the numbers being too high on previous days. Because of such corrections, it is possible for the current day’s cumulative number to be lower than the number for the day before. This is then depicted as 0 (zero) on the dashboard, as a negative number is confusing. This is why discrepancies arise when regional data is aggregated into national data. If you would use the negative values of the safety regions to calculate the daily number of confirmed cases, you would find the correct values. "

For the figures shown on the dashboard, the OSIRIS-data base is still used as the source. This is because in the Stichting Nice data, the reports cannot yet be matched to safety regions or municipalities.\n\nSince 1 May 2020, only admissions were counted where it was not indicated that the admission was due to another reason than COVID-19. This gives a more accurate presentation of how many people are extremely sick due to COVID-19. This number is one of the indicators for the development of the epidemic.\n\nThe source file contains figures per municipality. The national figure is achieved by adding the municipality figures together. Figures are also calculated for each of the safety regions, using the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) [allocation of municipalities](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84721NED/table?dl=3A154) to safety regions.\n\nPlease note: in the source file not all reports mention a municipality. This means that we cannot match these reports to a safety region or a municipality.

The average is obtained by adding up each day’s figures (today, yesterday and the day before), dividing the total by three and rounding off the answer to one decimal place.\n\nOur aim is to collect early indications of infection, so we use the most recent data and the date of notification."

The date used is the date of notification. This is not the same as the day on which people were tested. \n\nThe RIVM can retroactively correct data that was previously published. These corrections are then applied to the open data file on their site and will automatically be shown on the dashboard. \n\nThe source file contains figures per safety region and municipality. To obtain the national figures, all reports are added. In the sourcefile, not all reports mention a municipality or a safety region because this information is not available. These cannot be shown on that lower level, but will be shown in the national figures. \n\nThe increase in the number of daily confirmed cases is calculated by deducting the current day’s cumulative number of from the cumulative number reported the day before. This produces the absolute number of daily confirmed cases reported, as shown on the dashboard.\n\nWe use the absolute number of confirmed cases to calculate a relative rate per 100,000 inhabitants. We do this by first dividing the number of confirmed cases by the number of inhabitants in the Netherlands. This produces the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants, as shown on the dashboard. The number of inhabitants is determined by this [CBS file](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84721NED/table?dl=3A154).\n \nThe division of new cases by age group is based on the national figures, because ages are not recorded in the file containing municipal data. The table on the RIVM website in the 'COVID-19 weekly epidemiological update of the Netherlands' may therefore not always match the table on the dashboard.\n\nThe alert value for the number of confirmed cases is now added to the dashboard. The value is 7 confirmed cases per 100.000 inhabitants. This means that if this value reached, the number of infections is possibly increasing too fast to keep the novel coronavirus under control. The same value is also used by Germany for example. An alert value functions as a “warning” to examine the situation with urgency.

Reproduction numbers (R) using data from less than two weeks ago are not reliable because the R depends on the incubation period (the time between someone becoming infected and becoming ill) and the reporting delay (the time between someone becoming ill and being reported as a COVID-19 case). That is why the line depicting R stops at a date two weeks in the past.\n\nThere is a clear break in the R trend on 11 June. On that date, RIVM began calculating R using the number of daily positive tests and the number of hospital admissions. Before 11 June, the R was based only on the number of new hospital admissions. With a low number of new admissions, the number of daily positive tests is a better indicator of R."

The information on the dashboard will be updated as soon as this method is available.\n\nSometimes there seems to be a discrepancy between the new number of nursing homes with infected inhabitants, and the increase in the total amount of infected nursing homes compared to the day before. This is due to the fact that by newly infected nursing location, only the number is shown from the previous day. However, new infected nursing homes are not only reported from the day before, but sometimes earlier as well. As a consequence \"the number of new locations since yesterday\" is not always the same as the increase in total number of infected nursing homes.

We do this by dividing the Netherlands’ total population by 100,000. Then, we divide the absolute number of infectious people by the outcome of that division. The resulting figure is the number of infectious people per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe RIVM bases the number of infectious people on the daily reports of the number of people with COVID-19. Until 30 June this value was based on the daily number of patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19. Because the number of people currently being admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 is low, the number of people reported as having COVID-19 is a better indicator to track the progression of the number of infectious people.\n\nRIVM calculates the number of infectious people based on the number of infected people and the duration of the infectious period. The duration of the infectious period differs from one person to another, but is between 6 and 10 days. The number of infected people is based on the number of COVID-19 cases reported. RIVM uses a conversion factor to take account of people who are infected with coronavirus but who remain unreported. The conversion factor is derived from confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions and the percentage of people whose blood contains antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. RIVM is considerate of the fact that a tiny percentage of the tests could give a false positive result.\n\nThere is no alert value for the number of infectious people as this number is an estimate based on a calculation."

Dit onderzoek laat zien hoeveel virusdeeltjes in het rioolwater zitten afkomstig uit ontlasting van een deel van de besmette personen. Op elke locatie testen onderzoekers van het RIVM eens per week rioolwater dat over 24 uur verzameld is. Per week kan het aantal gemeten locaties variëren, omdat niet elke meting succesvol wordt afgerond. In het open data bestand staat per datum bij welke locaties gemeten is. Let op dat de cijfers van vóór 20 juli zijn gebaseerd op circa 28 locaties. De cijfers tussen 20 juli en 31 augustus zijn gebaseerd op circa 80 locaties. Vanaf 31 augustus wordt er gemeten op circa 300 locaties. In het huidige onderzoek kunnen trends in aantallen virusdeeltjes zoals een stijging of daling worden gezien. Meer onderzoek is nodig om conclusies aan deze trends te kunnen verbinden.De aantallen kunnen niet vergeleken worden tussen locaties. Deze duiding volgt nog. \n\nDe gegevens worden wekelijks (op dinsdag) geleverd als open data door het [RIVM](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_rioolwaterdata.csv). Met het beschikbaar komen van meer gegevens kan het aantal virusdeeltjes nauwkeuriger bepaald worden. Het RIVM hanteert sinds 18 augustus een aangepaste rekenmethode om het aantal virusdeeltjes per milliliter te bepalen. In het open data bestand staat aangegeven of een meting representatief is of niet, in het dashboard maken we alleen gebruik van representatieve data.\n\nIn de grafiek staat op de Y-as het aantal virusdeeltjes in een milliliter rioolwater. Op de X-as staat de datum waarop het het rioolwater is verzameld. Het landelijk en regionale gemiddelde betreft een weekgemiddelde. De som van de geleverde waarden in de week, wordt gedeeld door het aantal locaties waarover meetwaarden voor die week geleverd zijn. De gerapporteerde weken lopen van maandag t/m zondag. De gemeten waarden per afzonderlijke locatie staan in de grafiek op de datum waarop de monstername van het rioolwater is gestart.\n\nDe getoonde virusdeeltjes per milliliter kunnen worden beïnvloed door een aantal extra factoren. Regenval bijvoorbeeld kan het aantal gemeten deeltjes per milliliter verlagen, doordat het rioolwater door hemelwater wordt verdund. Ook kunnen aangesloten industriegebieden ditzelfde effect hebben, omdat daar in het rioolwater meestal geen of nauwelijks menselijke ontlasting te vinden is. Tevens kunnen de aantal virusdeeltjes per milliliter zo laag zijn, dat het niet gemeten wordt. Dit leidt dan tot een meting met een waarde van nul deeltjes per milliliter.\n\nOm te bepalen welke locatie tot welke veiligheidsregio behoort, wordt gekeken naar het verzorgingsgebied van de locatie. Dit is het gebied waarvoor de zuiveringsinstallatie afvalwater zuivert. Het RIVM levert per locatie aan voor hoeveel procent deze in een veiligheidsregio valt. Deze verdeling is nog niet volledig accuraat en wordt de komende tijd verder uitgewerkt. Sommige locaties hebben een verzorgingsgebied dat meerdere veiligheidsregio’s bevat. Indien dat zo is, wordt de locatie op het dashboard volledig toegewezen aan de veiligheidsregio dat het grootste deel van het verzorgingsgebied omvat. Voor het koppelen van locaties met gemeenten wordt momenteel gekeken naar de postcode van de locatie. Met gebruik van de CBS indeling gemeente voor postcode wordt vervolgens deze postcode vertaald naar een gemeente. In een paar gevallen kwam hier geen match uit. Voor die uitzonderingen is handmatig op basis van coördinaten gekeken op de kaart tot welke gemeente de locaties behoren. Let op: deze koppelingen zijn mogelijk niet volledig accuraat, want het verzorgingsgebied van een zuiveringsinstallatie hoeft niet gelijk te lopen met gemeentegrenzen. Er wordt gewerkt aan een meer nauwkeurige koppeling tussen locatie en gemeente."
