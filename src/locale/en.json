    "vragen": [
      {
        "vraag": "What is the dashboard for?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard presents up-to-date information about coronavirus in the Netherlands. It uses data provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals. The dashboard shows, for example, how many people have been tested for the virus, and how many tested positive."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why a dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "Over the past several months, many people have become ill because of coronavirus and many people have died. Until there is an effective vaccine, the virus can easily flare up and again make large numbers of people ill. The dashboard shows if and where the virus is gaining ground. Using this information we can take control measures faster and in a more targeted way, such as introducing additional measures only in the regions with sharply increasing infection rates. Measures must always be based on a comprehensive political assessment of all relevant aspects, including broader social and economic interests."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Whose dashboard is it?",
        "antwoord": "This dashboard has been commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. New types of data will be added to it in the weeks ahead."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why use these figures?",
        "antwoord": "The data on the dashboard gives a good overall view of the situation regarding coronavirus in the Netherlands. Some of the figures are about the virus and new outbreaks. Other figures help administrators to better calculate the risk of new waves of infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why is the dashboard still being developed?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard will remain under development as long as coronavirus is still with us, because we are always looking to see if we can add better data. Moreover, it takes time to set up the dashboard properly. So we’re expanding it step by step. We also want the information on this website to be easy to read on any device, and to be available in Dutch and in English. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What is an alert value?",
        "antwoord": "An alert value is a kind of ‘alarm bell’, determined by the Ministry of VWS. These alarm bells can go off if a large number of people test positive, fall ill or are admitted to hospital at the same time. It’s been calculated that the healthcare sector would soon be unable to cope if daily hospital admissions for COVID-19 exceed 40 per day for an extended period of time. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What can I use the figures about my municipality or region for?",
        "antwoord": "Coronavirus doesn’t spread uniformly. Sometimes it flares up in one region, while in others the infection rate remains low. If we have an accurate picture of this, we can combat the virus quickly and in a targeted manner. That’s why the data on the dashboard is also broken down by municipality/region. This also helps mayors decide if local measures are necessary."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Is this one of the apps that was announced?",
        "antwoord": "No, this is not an app. An anonymous contact tracing app is being developed so that people can find out if they might have been in close proximity to someone carrying coronavirus, and to advise them what to do. A home monitoring app will help the municipal health service (GGD) stay in touch with people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Does the dashboard respect my privacy?",
        "antwoord": "Yes, the dashboard complies with privacy rules, so the data can’t be traced back to individuals. All the data is provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), municipal health services (GGDs) and hospitals, and is accessible to everyone. The dashboard lists its data sources. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What conclusions can I draw based on the information on this dashboard?",
        "antwoord": "The dashboard shows how the situation per region is developing with regard to coronavirus. The data is used by municipal, regional and central government authorities to decide on the measures necessary to stop the spread of the virus."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "I can see that coronavirus is under control in my region. So why do the same measures apply here as in other regions?",
        "antwoord": "The situation varies widely, and some regions have been worse affected than others. But the virus can easily spread across the country and that’s why many measures apply nationwide. Sometimes, extra measures are taken in a specific region if there are many extra cases there. These are largely based on input from experts, and consultations with the GGDs and safety regions. "
      },
      {
        "vraag": "I’ve found a technical vulnerability in the website. Where can I report this?",
        "antwoord": "We work together with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Please notify them of the vulnerability as soon as possible using their [form](https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden/cvd-meldingen-formulier) before making the issue publicly known.

        "vraag": "Who can I contact with questions about coronavirus and COVID-19?",
        "antwoord": "Please call the public information number 0800-1351 from within the Netherlands (open between 8.00 and 20.00). From outside the Netherlands, call +31 20 205 1351."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "Why do I find a different value for the total number of confirmed cases (people who tested positive) as shown on the site, if I add all the reported confirmed cases per safety region? ",
        "antwoord": "We calculate the increase in the number of confirmed cases (people who tested positive) by deducting the current day’s cumulative number of confirmed cases reported from the cumulative number reported the day before. Any corrections to historical data, such as double counting, are processed by the RIVM on the day the error was discovered. This means the number of new cases reported for that day is lower than the actual number, but this is offset by the numbers being too high on previous days. Because of such corrections, it is possible for the current day’s cumulative number to be lower than the number for the day before. This is then depicted as 0 (zero) on the dashboard, as a negative number is confusing. This is why discrepancies arise when regional data is aggregated into national data. If you would use the negative values of the safety regions to calculate the daily number of confirmed cases, you would find the correct values."

The description of this dataset can be found [here](https://www.databronnencovid19.nl/Bron?naam=Nationale-Intensive-Care-Evaluatie). The average number of daily hospital admissions is calculated using the figures for one day ago, two days ago and three days ago. Data for the present day is not included in this calculation, as the present day is not yet over and registration data is therefore incomplete. Although hospitals strive to register COVID-19 patients as fast as possible, there is usually some delay. As a result, the figures for the previous several days tend to be incomplete. That is why data on the dashboard is refreshed daily.\n\nPreviously, new hospital admissions on a national level were based on [open data](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_aantallen_gemeente_per_dag.csv) from RIVM. The description of this dataset can be found [here](https://data.rivm.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/5f6bc429-1596-490e-8618-1ed8fd768427). This dataset uses the Osiris database. However, this database suffers from significant underreporting. The NICE database is more complete and uses a broader definition of hospital admission. RIVM figures include only those patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19, whereas NICE figures also include patients who were admitted to the hospital for another reason but also have COVID-19.\n\nCurrently data from NICE is not available on the level of safety regions and municipalities. Unitil November 30 2020 hospital admissions for safety regions and municipalities shown on this dashboard where based on the Osiris database. This data no longer sufficiently aligned with the actual numbers. From December 10 we expect to show admissions per safety region and municipality again, based on data from NICE.\n\nHospital occupancy rates (non-ICU) are obtained daily via [open data](https://lcps.nu/wp-content/uploads/covid-19.csv) from LCPS. The description of this dataset can be found [here](https://lcps.nu/datafeed/). The total occupancy numbers are not available prior to the 1st of June because certain quality checks have not been performed before this date.

        "verantwoording": "The number of positive tests (confirmed cases) is supplied daily via [open data](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/COVID-19_aantallen_gemeente_per_dag.csv) by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). The description of this dataset can be found [here](https://data.rivm.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/5f6bc429-1596-490e-8618-1ed8fd768427?tab=relations). The figures show the daily positive tests reported to RIVM in the preceding 24 hours, up to 10:00 on the day of publication. The date attributed to positive tests is the date on which RIVM was notified. This is not the same as the day on which people were tested. \n\nDoctors and laboratories in the Netherlands are required by law to report cases of certain infectious diseases to the municipal health service (GGD). However, coronavirus tests are increasingly being carried out by commercial organisations and individuals, and the results are not always reported to the GGD. Moreover, tests that do not meet the standards of the National Diagnostic Chain Coordination Team (LCDK) or RIVM are not counted (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/testen/soorten-testen/ontwikkeling-van-sneltesten-op-corona). In other words, the figure for daily positive tests published on the dashboard may not be 100% accurate. This must be kept in mind when interpreting the figures. \n\nTest results are transferred from laboratories to the GDD and RIVM using different IT systems and is partly done manually, which delays the process somewhat. The GGD needs to question infected persons or their relatives to collect important data, so there is a time lag between a test result becoming known and RIVM being notified. A rise in the number of infected persons or a technical malfunction can lead to notification backlogs. So the data provided for the previous 24-hour period does not include all newly confirmed cases at the moment that RIVM accesses the data file. However, the data is always corrected with any late notifications that come in. Delays in reporting can skew the daily figures for positive tests. The moving average filters out daily fluctuations and thus provides a better picture of the trend in the number of infections. \n\nSometimes RIVM has to correct data that has already been published. These are not content-related corrections, but concern minor procedural errors, such as a typo in a GGD questionnaire, or the wrong selection of an answer category. These corrections are also processed in the open data file and incorporated in the dashboard. \n\nThe database provides figures per safety region and municipality. National figures are obtained by adding up all the notifications. In some cases, notifications cannot be linked to a particular municipality/safety region. These cannot therefore be shown at that level, but they are included in the national figures. We calculate the relative rate of infection in the following way. First, we divide the Netherlands’ total population by 100,000. We then divide the number of daily positive tests by the outcome of that division. This gives us the number of daily positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants. This makes it possible to compare individual municipalities and safety regions. The number of inhabitants is based on data supplied by Statistics Netherlands [CBS-indeling](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84721NED/table?dl=3A154). \nThe division of new cases by age group is based on the national figures because ages are not recorded in the file containing municipal data. The table on the RIVM website may therefore not always match the table on the dashboard. \n\nA system of alert values has been set up. They signal when a situation has become alarming and needs urgent attention. The alert value for the number of confirmed cases a day is 7 per 100,000 inhabitants. This is the stage at which the number of infections is increasing too fast to keep the virus under control. The same alert value is also used in Germany. \n\nThe percentage of positive tests is based solely on tests carried out by the GGD for which the result is known. This is because the GGD is the only organisation that reports negative test results as well as positive ones. Negative results of any tests not carried out by the GGD are not reported to the GGD or to RIVM. RIVM provides the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport with weekly data relating to the GGD test centres (for example number of people tested and average processing time)."

The value of R is based on (1) the number of ICU and hospital admissions, and (2) the day on which these ICU and hospital patients developed symptoms. The most up to date value of R provided on the coronavirus dashboard at any given time is always from at least two weeks ago. \n\nEstimates of R using data from less than 14 days ago could provide an indication of what the definitive value may be, but are not reliable predictors. Estimates using more recent data are less reliable because the data is not yet complete. It is, for instance, impossible to know how many newly confirmed cases will result in hospital admissions in the days ahead. \n\nUntil 3 November 2020, the graph showing the progression of R over time did not give a value of R for the most recent two weeks but did give a projection of this value in the form of a bandwidth.

The description of this dataset can be found [here](https://data.rivm.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/0179dd26-7bf6-4021-857f-8623aaf8e73a). This data cannot always be clearly linked to a specific safety region. As a result, the total sum of numbers at the safety-region level may be less than the numbers at the national level. The number of deaths of nursing home residents is based on the date of death. However, when the date of death is unknown that death is not included in this statistic in the dashboard.\n\nThe method used to estimate the numbers of nursing homes and nursing home residents infected with coronavirus has been improved. Since 1 July 2020, for every person newly infected with coronavirus, the municipal health services (GGDs) have noted whether that person lives in a nursing home. Until the end of September 2020, no use was made of this data and a different method was used to calculate infection numbers, which led to a significant overestimate of the number of infected nursing homes. As of 29 September 2020, the estimates on the dashboard from 1 July 2020 onwards have been recalculated using the this data and therefore now give a much better picture of the actual number of infected nursing homes and nursing home residents.\n\nOld definition of a nursing home resident: A person was counted as a nursing home resident if, according to the central database OSIRIS: on the basis of their postcode, they can be linked to a registered nursing home or residential care home for the elderly, a setting (place where infection may have occurred) labelled as a ‘nursing home’ or something similar, or if there is any other term that links them in the database to a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly. In addition, the person:\n- must be over 70 years old\n- must not be a health worker, and\n- must not be employed.\n\nNew definition of a nursing home resident: As of 1 July 2020, every time a person tests positive for COVID-19, the GGD asks whether that person is a resident of a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly. This information is used in the new definition. A person is considered to be a nursing home resident if, according to the data in OSIRIS:\n- This person is a resident of a nursing home or a residential care home for the elderly.\n- If it is not known whether the person lives in a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly, the old definition is used.\n\nThe total number of nursing homes per safety region is provided by RIVM. Any nursing homes with the same postcode are counted as one nursing home. This is because the number of infected nursing homes is also determined by postcode. It is necessary to know the total number of nursing homes per safety region in order to calculate what percentage of nursing homes in the safety region is infected. The total number of nursing homes nationwide is the sum of the total number of nursing homes in all safety regions."

A person who carries coronavirus can infect other people within a certain time frame. How long someone is infectious for differs from person to person. Using a range of data sources regarding the number of people infected with the virus in a specific time frame, it is possible to estimate the number of infectious people in the Netherlands. See [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/hoe-berekeningen-bijdragen-aan-bestrijding-van-virus) for more information regarding the method. There is no alert value for the number of infectious people as this number is an estimate based on a calculation.\n\nThe calculation method of the number of infectious people has been changed since 13 October. Between 1 June till 13 October this number was calculated based on the results of the first [Pienter Corona research](https://www.rivm.nl/pienter-corona-studie), the number of hospital admissions and the number of confirmed cases. From 13 October onwards, this number is calculated based on the results of the second Pienter Corona research and the number of hospital admissions. In this second research, a larger group of people have been examined. Besides, more insight in the infectiousness of people has been gained."

Human excrement flushed down the toilet can contain pathogens (viruses and bacteria that can make people sick), which can be measured in wastewater. These tests measure the concentration of coronavirus particles in wastewater that may (but do not always) come from the excrement of infected individuals. Measurements are collected at more than 300 wastewater treatment plants around the country. At least once a week at each location, researchers from the RIVM test a sample of wastewater collected over a 24-hour period. The weekly number of locations with new data varies however, because not every test is completed successfully. The open data shows at which locations tests were done on a given date. \n\nAs of 3 November 2020, the dashboard no longer shows the number of virus particles in one millilitre of wastewater. Instead it shows the number of virus particles per 100,000 inhabitants. Assisted by the water authorities, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) has calculated the number of inhabitants served by each wastewater treatment plant, so that RIVM can determine the number of virus particles per 100,000 inhabitants. RIVM now also corrects for the volume of water flowing into the plant at the time of sampling, which is called the flow rate. Rainwater, for example, has a diluting effect. However, it can only retrospectively correct the data from 7 September 2020, which means that data from before that date is no longer shown on the dashboard. This coincides with the fact that the number of testing locations was increased from roughly 80 to 318 on 7 September 2020.    \n\nIf the number of virus particles in a sample is too low to be measured, the value is recorded as 0. Sometimes RIVM will indicate that a measurement isn’t representative. These measurements are filtered out when data is entered in the dashboard. The current study makes trends visible, such as an increase or decrease in the number of virus particles. But more research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn about these trends. \n\nThe weekly average is calculated by first determining the average of all measurements taken at a sampling site in a given week, and then using this to determine the average of all sampling sites for that week per municipality, safety region or for the country as a whole. A week runs from Monday to Sunday. The weekly average is calculated on the following Tuesday, so that the week is complete and the RIVM has time to receive and analyse the samples, and report on them. Please note that additional data relating to the preceding week or even the weeks before that may be received after Tuesday. This is why the open data file is read every day and the weekly averages recalculated. Any corrections relating to previous weeks are also entered in the dashboard. The graph shows the value of the sample for each location and the date on which it was collected.\n\nWastewater treatment plants are allocated to a safety region based on their catchment area, that is, the area from which wastewater flows to that plant to be treated. RIVM indicates what percentage of a location falls under a certain safety region. This distribution is not yet entirely accurate and will be finetuned in the coming period. The catchment area of some locations fall under more than one safety region. In that case, the location can be found on the dashboard under the safety region in which the biggest share of its catchment area falls. Locations are linked to municipalities on the basis of their postcode, using Statistics Netherlands’ distribution of postcodes per municipality. Sometimes this did not result in a match. In these exceptional cases, the location’s coordinates were looked up on a map to see which municipality it falls under. Please note that the link to a particular municipality may not be entirely accurate because a wastewater treatment plant’s catchment area may not coincide exactly with municipal boundaries. We are working to make a more accurate link between sewage treatment plant locations and municipalities.\n\nThe legend of the national map has been revised on the x of November. This shows differences between security region more clearly."

When people get tested for coronavirus, the GGD also records certain personal details, such as their age and whether they live in a nursing home or disability care home.

This assessment is carried out jointly by central government, the municipal health services (GGDs), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the safety regions. The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport then determines which risk level applies to each region. Do we need to exercise ‘caution’ (level 1), is the situation one of ‘concern’ (level 2) or is the situation ‘serious’ (level 3) or even ‘severe’ (level 4)?\n\nCentral government and/or the safety region in question will take appropriate measures based on the risk level. Measures depend on the local situation and may therefore vary from region to region.",
    "vragen": [
      {
        "vraag": "What determines a region’s risk level?",
        "antwoord": "A region’s risk level is determined by looking at the situation in that region, in the surrounding regions and in the rest of the country. This is done on the basis of the coronavirus dashboard, RIVM’s weekly report, and assessments by the GGDs and the safety regions.\n\nSeveral aspects are taken into consideration when determining the risk level:\n\n- How quickly is the number of new infections rising?\n- Are additional measures needed for vulnerable groups?\n- How effective is contact tracing?\n- How well are the measures being complied with?\n- Is there still sufficient healthcare capacity?"
      },
      {
        "vraag": "When is a region’s risk level raised to ‘concern’, ‘serious’ or ‘severe’?",
        "antwoord": "- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘caution’ to ‘concern’ if there are more than 50 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. This means that the alert value of 7 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants is exceeded each day.\n- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘concern’ to ‘serious’ if there are more than 150 positive test results per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.\n- A region’s risk level is in principle raised from ‘serious’ to ‘severe’ if there are more than 250 positive test results per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. If the situation is ‘severe’ in multiple regions, the severest measures then apply to the whole country.\n\nEvery Monday RIVM calculates which risk level applies to which region. A more in-depth assessment of the situation in these regions is carried out in the following days. If the situation in a region is one of ‘concern’ or ‘serious’, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (Hugo de Jonge) may decide to assign a higher risk level to that region. The above criteria are intended as a guideline. Even if a region has not yet reached the alert values given above, the risk level may nevertheless be scaled up in light of circumstances and assessments."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "When can the risk level in a region be scaled down?",
        "antwoord": "Any decision to scale down the risk level in a region requires careful consideration of not only the number of new infections, but also healthcare capacity. After all, even if the number of new infections falls, the healthcare sector may still be dealing with large numbers of patients recovering from COVID-19. Healthcare professionals must also be given an opportunity to rest. The focus must be on preventing the virus from spreading quickly once more and the healthcare system becoming overburdened."
      },
      {
        "vraag": "What do the four risk levels mean?",
        "antwoord": "1. Caution. The situation is manageable. The number of new infections is low. Vulnerable groups must remain alert. Contact tracing is largely effective. Measures are being sufficiently complied with and are enforceable. There is sufficient healthcare capacity. Any additional measures are designed to make the existing approach more effective.\n2. Concern. The situation is moving in a negative direction. The number of new infections is increasing. A tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. If the situation continues, contact tracing will become ineffective. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. Pressure on healthcare capacity is increasing. The existing approach needs to be strengthened through additional measures to get the virus under control again and return to a manageable situation.\n3. Serious. Severe measures are needed to prevent further escalation and return to a manageable situation. The number of new infections is increasing rapidly. An intensive tailored approach is needed to protect vulnerable groups. Contact tracing is no longer effective, making it more difficult to keep track of how the virus is spreading. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. There is insufficient healthcare capacity. Measures to be taken are designed to prevent regional healthcare from becoming overburdened and to be able to track the spread of the virus again.\n4. Severe. More severe national measures are needed to prevent further escalation and return to a manageable situation. A very large number of people are infectious and the number of new infections is high. Contact tracing is no longer effective, meaning there is limited insight into how the virus is spreading. Measures are not being sufficiently complied with. Regional healthcare capacity is insufficient and some kinds of regular healthcare have already been scaled down. Measures to be taken are designed to prevent national and regional healthcare from becoming overburdened and to regain maximum control of the virus."
