/**
 * --> THIS SCRIPT WILL POTENTIALLY BREAK PRODUCTION BUILD IF RAN HALFWAY SPRINT <--
 *
 * This script will finalize move mutations and also prunes any LokalizeText
 * documents from the production dataset that are not present in the development
 * dataset anymore. The latter is purely a cleanup mechanism, as additional
 * unused keys have no effect on the application.
 *
 * This code should be executed only right after a major release at which point
 * we can be fairly certain that whatever keys are not in the development
 * dataset can also be removed from production.
 *
 * As an extra this script will also look at any text documents that are in
 * development but not yet in production and add those. Normally text additions
 * should flow via the sync-after-feature script, but there might be an edge
 * case were things fall through. Syncing those documents here will assure that
 * we can always have production mirror development exactly. This is based on
 * the assumption that it can not hurt to inject a new key to production that
 * has been created around release time since these documents typically contain
 * placeholder texts.
