    "bericht": "The number of newly tested COVID positives slightly decreased to 35.635 cases in the week of 20 to 26 January compared to the week before. This overview is overshadowed by the rising number of cases involving the SARS-CoV-2 variant that resulted in a massive influx of patients in hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is estimated that the people that got infected with COVID-19 in the past week (20 to 26 January), more than a third is infected with the UK variant. We are facing two variants of the virus that seem to be spreading in the Netherlands at different speeds. As a result, there are essentially two separate COVID-19 epidemics: one epidemic involving the ‘old’ variant, in which infections are decreasing, and another epidemic involving the UK variant, in which infections are increasing.",

This is nearly 200 more than expected for this period and slightly more than in the previous week (3,132). Mortality was higher than expected among people aged 65 to 79 in particular. There was also excess mortality was among people under 65. Mortality among long-term care users was again below the expected level. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) reports this based on the provisional weekly mortality figures. From week 39 of 2020 to week 6 of 2021, weekly mortality was higher than expected. There was excess mortality until week 3. In the following weeks, mortality was not elevated and fluctuated around the expected numbers for that period. The estimate for week 15 is almost 200 deaths above the expected number, but is still just within the range of usual fluctuations (and is therefore not classified as excess mortality). The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) registered 126 COVID-19 deaths in week 15 (as at 20 April).",
