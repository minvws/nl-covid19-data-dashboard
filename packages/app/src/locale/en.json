    "bericht": "A moderately positive overview can be observed in the week of 13 to 19 January, as an effect of the lockdown that started on 15 December. In that week, the reported number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 decreased by 21.5% compared to the week before, dropping to 38.776 newly reported COVID-19 infections. This overview is overshadowed by the rising number of cases involving the SARS-CoV-2 variant that resulted in a massive influx of patients in hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is estimated that in the Netherlands about 10% of the people who became infected last week have the more contagious UK variant. That is twice as many compared to the week before that. \nWe are facing two variants of the virus that seem to be spreading in the Netherlands at different speeds. As a result, there are essentially two separate COVID-19 epidemics: one epidemic involving the ‘old’ variant, in which infections are decreasing, and another epidemic involving the UK variant, in which infections are increasing.",

    "description": "The blue bars on the right of this graph show the age distribution of people who have died from COVID 19. The grey bars on the left show how large each age group is in relation to the entire Dutch population. Taken together, the blue and grey bars show whether there are proportionately more or fewer COVID-19 deaths in each age group. If, for example, the graph shows that people in their sixties represent 12% of the Dutch population (grey bar) and that this same group represents 10% of the people in the Netherlands who have died from COVID-19 (blue bar), that means there are proportionately fewer deaths from COVID-19 among people in their sixties. The graph is updated daily and includes all deaths since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please note that RIVM groups COVID-19 deaths among people younger than 50 together; the low numbers could otherwise be traceable back to individual people.",
