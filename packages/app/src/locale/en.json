    "bericht": "The number of newly tested COVID positives slightly decreased to 35.635 cases in the week of 20 to 26 January compared to the week before. This overview is overshadowed by the rising number of cases involving the SARS-CoV-2 variant that resulted in a massive influx of patients in hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is estimated that the people that got infected with COVID-19 in the past week (20 to 26 January), more than a third is infected with the UK variant. We are facing two variants of the virus that seem to be spreading in the Netherlands at different speeds. As a result, there are essentially two separate COVID-19 epidemics: one epidemic involving the ‘old’ variant, in which infections are decreasing, and another epidemic involving the UK variant, in which infections are increasing.",

If, for example, the graph shows that people in their sixties represent 12% of the Dutch population (grey bar) and that this same group represents 10% of the people in the Netherlands who have died from COVID-19 (blue bar), that means there are proportionately fewer deaths from COVID-19 among people in their sixties.
